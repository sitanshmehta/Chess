    -Observation:
        -The application crashes when the line qDebug() << "i in select" << i; is commented out (118, board.cpp).
        -When the qDebug() statement is included, the application runs without crashing.
    -Possible causes
        -validMoves may have invalid pointers (which is a weird possibility since I have printed their attributes and also checked if they are null, maybe there are other ways to be invalid?)
        -Adding qDebug may prevent the crash by altering the programs memory usage / execution timing. i should look into other examples online
